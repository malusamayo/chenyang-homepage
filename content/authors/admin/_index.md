I am now a final-year undergraduate in Peking University advised by Prof. [Yingfei Xiong](https://xiongyingfei.github.io/).  Currently, I am also working with Prof. [Christian KÃ¤stner](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/) at Carnegie Mellon University and Prof. [Shurui Zhou](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~shuruiz/#page-top) at University of Toronto.

My research interests lie primarily in the field of software engineering and programming languages, with a focus on program analysis and its application to other fields of computer science, including machine learning, operating system and human-computer interaction. I am applying for a PhD position in this fall.
